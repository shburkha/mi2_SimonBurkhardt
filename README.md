# MI2 Jump Game
### by Simon Burkhardt, Matrikelnr.: 5105476

## Description
The goal of the game is to survive the level. You need to jump over the red obstacles,
but you can land on the grey platforms. You can jump by hitting space-bar. 

## Images
I used an image from a copy-right free site for the background (https://www.pexels.com/de-de/foto/blaue-und-gelbe-bokeh-lichter-159027/),
all the other images were created in Adobe Illustrator. You can find the Illustrator file in the assets folder.

## Installation
Phaser3 requires you to run the game on a local web server. While developing this game I used the build-in server from Webstorm.
